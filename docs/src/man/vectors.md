## Compact vectors

The abstract type for vectors with a finite number of non-zero elements is

```@docs
InfiniteVectors.AbstractFiniteNZInfiniteVector
```

### CompactInfiniteVector
There are two types that support compact vectors. The second one is fully typed.
```@docs
CompactInfiniteVector
FixedInfiniteVector
```
For the dirac delta a special constructor is present. 
```@docs
